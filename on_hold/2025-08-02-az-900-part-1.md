# My Azure AZ-900 Learning Journey: Working Through Cloud Fundamentals

*Personal notes as I work through the eCollege.ie Azure course - documenting what's clicking and what I'm still figuring out*

## Background

I've got some AWS experience and my Security+ cert, but realized I had gaps in my cloud knowledge when Azure kept coming up in conversations. The free eCollege.ie course seemed like a good way to fill those gaps, so here I am working through the AZ-900 learning objectives.

These are essentially my study notes as I try to wrap my head around these concepts.

---

## Learning Objective: Identify the Benefits of Cloud Computing

### High Availability
The course defines this as systems being available when needed, typically measured in percentages (99.9%, 99.99%, etc.). Azure achieves this through multiple data centers and automatic failover.


### Scalability vs Elasticity
I initially thought these were more or less the same thing, but they're not:
- **Scalability**: The ability to increase or decrease resources
- **Elasticity**: Automatically doing that scaling based on demand

### Agility
This seems to be about speed of deployment and change. Instead of waiting weeks for new hardware, you can provision resources in minutes.

Honest question I'm wrestling with: Is this always better? There's something to be said for the deliberate planning that slower processes force.

### Disaster Recovery
The cloud approach seems to be "assume things will fail and plan accordingly" rather than trying to prevent all failures. As the Mythbusters taught me - "Failure is always an option!" Azure gives us options of multiple geographic regions, and automated backups, so we can try to keep our data safe and business up and running.

## Learning Objective: Understand CapEx vs OpEx

### Capital Expenditure (CapEx)
Traditional model: Buy servers, networking equipment, etc. Large upfront costs, equipment depreciates over time.

### Operational Expenditure (OpEx) 
Cloud model: Pay monthly/hourly for what you use. Treated as operating expenses rather than capital investments.

### Consumption-Based Model
Pay for what you actually use rather than paying for capacity whether you use it or not.

## Learning Objective: Understand the Shared Responsibility Model

This concept is clearer coming from a security background. Basically, security and maintenance responsibilities are split between Microsoft and the customer, but where that split happens depends on the service type.

Microsoft always handles: Physical security, host infrastructure, network controls
Customer always handles: Data, identities, access management

The tricky part is understanding exactly where the line is drawn for different service types.

---

## Learning Objective: Describe Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)

**What it is**: You rent virtual machines, storage, and networks. Microsoft handles the physical hardware, you handle everything else.

**Azure examples**: Virtual Machines, Virtual Networks

**When you're responsible for**: OS updates, application installation, security patches, backup strategies


---

## Learning Objective: Describe Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

**What it is**: Microsoft manages the infrastructure AND the platform (OS, runtime, middleware). You focus on your applications.

**Azure examples**: App Service, Azure SQL Database

**What Microsoft handles**: OS patches, runtime updates, scaling infrastructure
**What you handle**: Your code, your data, application configuration

**My understanding**: Good middle ground between control and convenience. You can focus on building applications without worrying about server maintenance.

---

## Learning Objective: Describe Serverless Computing

**What it is**: You write code, Microsoft handles literally everything else. Pay only when your code actually runs.

**Azure examples**: Azure Functions, Logic Apps

**Key characteristics**: 
- Event-driven (code runs in response to triggers)
- Automatic scaling (including scaling to zero when not in use)
- No server management whatsoever

**What I'm trying to understand**: How do you debug or troubleshoot when you have no access to the underlying infrastructure? This seems powerful but also potentially limiting.

---

## Learning Objective: Describe Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)

**What it is**: Complete applications delivered over the internet. You just use the software.

**Azure examples**: Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365

**Responsibility**: Microsoft handles everything except your data and user management.

Most people are already using SaaS daily (Gmail, Slack, etc.) without thinking about it as "cloud computing".

---

## Learning Objective: Compare Cloud Computing Models

### Public Cloud
Resources shared among multiple organizations, managed by third-party providers like Microsoft.

**Pros**: Lower costs, no maintenance overhead, massive scale
**Cons**: Less control, shared infrastructure, potential compliance issues

### Private Cloud
Dedicated resources for one organization, either on-premises or hosted.

**Pros**: Maximum control, dedicated resources, easier compliance
**Cons**: Higher costs, you handle maintenance, limited scale

### Hybrid Cloud
Mix of public and private, connected so they can share data and applications. This probably describes most large organizations - some stuff in the cloud, some stuff on-premises, trying to make it all work together.

---

## What's Still Confusing Me

- **Compliance**: With my security background, I'm curious about how compliance frameworks map to shared responsibility models. Who's actually liable when something goes wrong?

- **Performance**: How does cloud performance compare to on-premises for latency-sensitive applications? One would assume on-premises would be faster, but even with my home server I experience very little latency on most services. 

## Next Steps

I've got a workbook and some labs to do next, then on to the next topic!
