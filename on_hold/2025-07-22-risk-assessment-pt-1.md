I'd hoped to be more active, but other less post-worthy events have help my attention and this is a post mostly just for me. I'll be starting postgraduate studies on cybersecurity risk & compliance in September, and I'd like to see how I learn and improve!

I've read and learned about risk assessments through my CompTIA certs, but never really thought to sit down and fully work one through.

For full disclosure - I'm working with Claude here to generate the company profile so I can jump in!

I'm following NIST's Quick Start Guide for Small Businesses. This **C**yber **S**ecurity **F**ramework
organises outcomes into six sections. Govern,

# STEP 1: GOVERN
## The Govern Function helps you establish and monitor your business’s cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy.- NIST 

As part of the Govern step, we need to consider the company's goverance strategy. First, we consider the company's mission statement, their core values and the risks that may prevent them from achieving their mission.

As per their CEO, their mission statement is:

> Mission Statement: Our mission is to make sure that all animals have contented and healthy lives, by rescuing and caring for those in need, rehoming pets to the people and families able to provide them with the happiness and care, promoting animal welfare and responsible ownership, and educating and supporting pet owners. 

Breaking this down, from a cybersecurity perspective:

"Rescuing and caring for animals in need":

* What if they can't access animal medical records during emergencies?
* What if their intake systems go down when animals need immediate help?

"Rehoming pets to families":

* What if their adoption database is compromised or unavailable?
* What if potential adopters lose trust due to a data breach?

"Promoting animal welfare and responsible ownership":

* What if their website and social media are hacked?
* What if they can't communicate with the public during a crisis?

"Educating and supporting pet owners":

* What if they lose access to educational resources or contact databases?
