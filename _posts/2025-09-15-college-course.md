# New Beginnings

I'd originally had grand plans for my blog here, to show off projects and what I was learning. First came the fallout of an accident back in May, then came obligations to Galway IT Meetup with Home Assistant and IoT meetups, and then came along something a little more exciting. 

This week, I’ve officially started a Higher Diploma in Science, specializing in Cybersecurity Risk and Compliance. This program has been developed in partnership with Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s Cyber Defense Center, which helps assure me that the curriculum aligns with real-world industry needs. 

The program includes modules covering:

Research Methods in IT – Developing critical thinking and modern research techniques applicable to computing problems.

Data Protection – Law and Compliance – Deep dives into GDPR, data privacy, and the role of Data Protection Officers.

Cyber Security Architecture – Practical measures and controls for mitigating cyber risks and ensuring compliance.

Secure Information and Event Management (SIEM) – Real-time threat monitoring, analytics, and best practices for cybersecurity incident response.

Cybersecurity Governance, Risk, and Compliance – Understanding governance frameworks, risk assessment methodologies, and compliance across various industries.

Cybersecurity Risk and Compliance Project – An independent research or practical project integrating knowledge from the program.

I’m looking forward to applying what I learn not just in theory, but in practical, real-world contexts - and I hope to share insights and experiences along the way.
